As part of the EN1190 Engineering Design Project, we developed a Bluetooth-enabled water level detection system to help users monitor and control household water levels efficiently. Using an Atmega328P microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor, it provides real-time alerts via a mobile app to prevent water and power wastage, motor damage, and inconvenience during power cuts. Designed with Altium (PCB) and SolidWorks (enclosure), the compact, low-power device operates even during outages. A survey showed 91.7% interest, confirming its demand. Despite challenges like waterproofing and budget constraints, our solution offers 24/7 monitoring with a 100m Bluetooth range, making it more efficient and durable than mechanical alternatives.
