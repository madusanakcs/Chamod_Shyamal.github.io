This project aimed to design a 10V linear power supply with a maximum current rating of 10A, capable of driving a high-power load (100W) from a 230V input voltage. The design incorporated rectification, smoothing, and regulation stages to ensure constant voltage output. Key features included voltage and current regulation mechanisms, along with protection circuits for short circuit, overcurrent, and thermal protection. The project culminated in the development of two PCB designs and a 3D-printed enclosure to house the components effectively.
