Developed a brain hemorrhage detection and localization system to identify intracranial hemorrhages.
Three models were analyzed, their performance metrics were defined, and ResNet150 was chosen for its effectiveness in identifying intracranial hemorrhages.
Six windowing methods were utilized, and the sigmoid BSB method was identified as the most effective.
Preprocessing data from a CSV file, comparing with the SOP Instance UID, and then opening the corresponding DICOM image and labels.
