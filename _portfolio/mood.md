The Mood Lamp Project is a customizable RGB LED lighting system with wireless remote control and music visualization features. Users can adjust color, brightness, and effects via a mobile app, while audio sensors sync lighting with sound. Built with Arduino/C++, the lamp includes a compact enclosure, efficient power management, and a well-designed PCB. Testing ensures stable performance, and future improvements may include smart home integration.
