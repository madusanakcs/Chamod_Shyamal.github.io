We designed and implemented both virtual and physical versions of an autonomous robot, each capable of performing a set of distinct tasks. These tasks included wall following, line maze solving, finding the shortest return path, escaping from a blind box, dotted line following, segmented wall following, completing a chessboard challenge, and even finishing a broken bridge by placing boxes. The project utilized various tools and technologies, such as Webots for virtual simulation, SolidWorks for designing the robot’s components, and Arduino/C++ for programming its behavior and controls. This dual approach of virtual and physical implementations effectively demonstrated the robot’s capabilities across a range of environments and challenges.
