The UOM LAN Backbone and ENTC Network Design Project focuses on creating a scalable and efficient network infrastructure for the University of Moratuwa (UOM) and the Engineering Technology (ENTC) department. The project involves designing and simulating a backbone network that connects key university buildings, including academic faculties, administrative offices, the library, and the CITeS data center. Additionally, a local area network (LAN) for the ENTC department is developed as a reference model. The design prioritizes long-term usability, cost optimization, and network resilience, ensuring seamless communication and resource sharing across the university. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, the team simulated network performance, analyzed traffic flow, and tested routing configurations.

A key feature of the project is the implementation of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing to efficiently manage network traffic while maintaining redundancy for uninterrupted connectivity. The IP addressing scheme incorporates both IPv4 and IPv6, ensuring scalability and adaptability to future networking demands. The network design also includes strategic fiber optic selections—single-mode and multimode fiber—based on distance requirements and future scalability. The team carefully selected routers and switches to align with performance needs and created a Bill of Quantities (BOQ) for all components. Simulations verified the network’s ability to handle real-world scenarios, such as routing traffic during backbone failures, ensuring continuous access to essential services like LMS platforms and research collaboration tools.
