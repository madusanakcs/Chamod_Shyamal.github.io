## Concentration of Volume of a Hypercube

A p-dimensional unit hypercube is the subset of ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b69a96c6-5ef9-4b38-a6ae-a1fb860b68a1) defined as

 - The hyper cube has ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cbe5866-e4ab-4631-914e-b04c56f091fc) vertices
 - Therefore, the maximum length between any two points admits ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c47e9172-4f4f-4ff7-b500-0c66994b6978)


 - As p increases,dmax also increases, therefore, the corners tend to stretch
 - Since the volume is unity, the rest of thehypercube should shrink to
 keep the volume fixed
 - The volume seems to concentrate at the corners as ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d60d93f9-eae4-4c0e-80d3-9afd5e2c57a9)

### Practical Implications

1. **Distance Metrics**: Euclidean distances become less meaningful in high dimensions.
2. **Normalization**: Data should often be scaled to a unit sphere or hypercube.
3. **Sampling**: Random points in high dimensions are almost always near edges/shells.
