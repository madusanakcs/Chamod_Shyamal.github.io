In Formula 1, determining the "greatest" driver involves evaluating a combination of individual skills and the performance of their car. Key metrics include braking efficiency, cornering speed, throttle control, and steering precision. For instance, braking performance is assessed by how effectively a driver decelerates into corners, with data showing that drivers like Daniel Ricciardo and Pastor Maldonado have demonstrated exceptional braking skills in past races. 
 
 Similarly, cornering speed reflects a driver's ability to navigate turns swiftly, which is crucial for maintaining competitive lap times. Throttle control measures how smoothly a driver applies acceleration, impacting both speed and tire management. Steering precision indicates how accurately a driver positions the car on the track, affecting overall performance.

However, a driver's performance is also heavily influenced by the car's capabilities. The Drag Reduction System (DRS), for example, allows drivers to adjust the rear wing to reduce aerodynamic drag and increase top speed, facilitating overtaking maneuvers. 
 
 Additionally, the car's braking system, suspension setup, and engine power significantly affect a driver's ability to execute maneuvers effectively. Therefore, while individual skill is vital, the synergy between driver and car performance is essential in determining the overall success in Formula 1 racing.
